# JoomlaDay Giveaway Component

Sponsors have generously donated **tons** of giveaways to many, many JoomlaDays. However, giveaways can take a while as numbers are called, email addresses are collected, and people in the restroom are skipped. Enter the JoomlaDay Giveaway component! This component allows you to list out all of the items to be given away, as well as all of the attendees and their email addresses. When you're ready to do the giveaway, go to the Swag List in the backend of the component. Then click **-select-** in the **Winner** column for each item you want to giveaway. This way, you can talk about each item before selecting a random winner.

The Gravatar of each winner is also displayed in the backend so that you can locate and congratulate them right away!
